# Gaggia PID Controller

This project is a PID controller for a `Gaggia Paros` (or Gaggia Classic) coffee machine using Arduino and a few other components.
This Arduino based controller improves the stability of the water temperature of the coffee machine by controlling the boiler with PID control loop feedback.

## Credits

A big thank you goes to these two other projects that helped me a lot in the understanding of the electric schematics of the coffee machine and the components to use:
- [RaspberryPI based](http://int03.co.uk/blog/project-coffee-espiresso-machine/)
- [Arduino based](http://www.cyberelectronics.org/?p=458)

## Components

This is the list of components required for this project:
- 1x Arduino (any board type will do)
- 1x Solid State Relay 40A
- 2x Digital temperature sensor TSic306
- 1x I2C LCD or OLED
- Wires and other utilities

# Schematics

The following is the original schematic of the coffee machine:
